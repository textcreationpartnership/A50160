            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord.</hi> The good Providence of God, had made this <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> a blessed Instrument of Rebuilding and Resettling <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which had been miserably Ruined by <hi>Chaldean</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Oppressions; from whence, in the twelfth year of his Government, he goes back into <hi>Persia,</hi> where he had been an eminent Officer in the Court of <hi>Artaxerxes Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> but from thence he soon repeats his Journey of above <hi>nine hundred miles,</hi> and revisits his beloved <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with a new Commission, by vertue of which he sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Redress divers Disorders, under which that little Common-wealth was labouring.</p>
            <p>The common People at this time were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Low;</hi> for they had usually many <hi>Children</hi> in their Families that call'd for more <hi>Bread</hi> than their single hands could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase for them; and yet they had heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> which the the Necessity and Calamity of their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49324:5"/> Affairs <hi>compelled</hi> them to the payment of. The People had no way, but the Borrowing of <hi>Money</hi> to defray all these Charges; but the Rich Lenders took them at this Disadvantage, so as not only to squeeze the cruel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt'rest of <hi>twelve in the Hundred</hi> from them, but also to seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Lands</hi> which they had Mortgaged for the <hi>Principal:</hi> Yea they hook'd the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Brethren into Slavery. Very loud complaints were now made, of these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; whereupon the Governour called a <hi>General Court,</hi> and procured the Relaxation of these Difficulties; he seems to erect a <hi>Bank of Credit</hi> among them, and render <hi>Credit</hi> so <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seable,</hi> that the indigent people might still enjoy their Livings, and yet have <hi>Credit</hi> enough to demand from one another what their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies called for. In the Speech which this Honourable Person made upon this occasion, he mentions his own <hi>Exemple</hi> as one <hi>Article,</hi> for the conviction of those who did in this time of Distress Exact upon their Neighbours. They had just before been under a Governour who not only made his Domestick Expences to stand the People in <hi>Five Pounds a Day,</hi> besides large quantities of Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>visions, for his Table; but also he had his little creatures about him, whom he used as <hi>Tools</hi> for the getting of <hi>Money,</hi> as often as he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49324:5"/> or they found a want thereof. But sayes our <hi>Nehemiah: So did not I, because of the fear of God!</hi> No, he would make none of those great Bargains, for which he had an opportunity in the Poverty and Penury of the People; but instead thereof, <hi>He</hi> denied himself of what was his <hi>Right.</hi> He refused the <hi>Salary</hi> which was due unto him as a <hi>Magistrate;</hi> and this, tho' he spent more time than ordinary in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Government: yea, He employed his own <hi>Servants</hi> in those matters for which there seem'd a lack of <hi>Hands;</hi> and He fed many scores above an hundred, of those that were proper Subjects for his Invitations, out of his own Estate. It was not with any <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> that He mentioned these things, but he brought them as a demonstration of his Desire, to ease the People of their <hi>Burdens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Text, is the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. No prudent <hi>Magistrate</hi> needs to be told that he ought to be a <hi>Man of Prayer:</hi> They that are to <hi>Act for</hi> God in Government should very much <hi>Be With</hi> God in Devotion. One of the greatest <hi>Magistrates</hi> that ever lived, could give that account of himself, in <hi>Psal. 1094. I give my self unto Prayer:</hi> but the Words in the Original are so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49324:6"/> been all made up of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Such a <hi>Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate</hi> was our <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here; every business would he both begin and conclude with <hi>Prayer;</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> was like his very Breath, issuing from him with a constant Respiration. Tis one of his <hi>Prayers</hi> that we are now to be entertained with: We will suppose that he <hi>Pray'd in Faith;</hi> and so there are two or three things in the Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We have the <hi>Declaration</hi> of a pious Ruler. He says, <hi>I have done for this people;</hi> he had been serviceable to the People of God. What had he <hi>done?</hi> Why, he had <hi>Addressed</hi> the King, on the behalf of his Ruined Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men; he had undergone a Travel of many <hi>Leagues</hi> to promote their Safety; he had entred upon the Administration of the <hi>Government,</hi> when it would have broke the Heart of any man alive to have medled with it; he had parted with a large portion of his <hi>Riches,</hi> for the use of the Publick; he had born with great <hi>Abuses</hi> from his Enemies; and whatever he saw amiss in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> he courageously set himself upon the Reformation of it.

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49324:7"/> who have chosen the Lord Jehovah for their Best Good, and their Last End; <hi>a people</hi> who have chosen the Lord Jesus for the Redeemer of their Souls; <hi>a people</hi> who have Believed and Practised according to the Scriptures of Truth: 'tis the <hi>people,</hi> whose Denomination is that, in Isa. 63. 18. <hi>The people of thy Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> or Gods Holy People.

            <p n="3">III. But the <hi>Main Assertion,</hi> which lies before us, is, That the God of Heaven has <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> for the men that study to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto His People.</p>
            <p>We are not so carnal, as to dream of a strict <hi>propriety</hi> in the Expression, when <hi>Thoughts</hi> are ascribed unto the Insinite God. The <hi>Thoughts</hi> are properly, those <hi>Conceptions</hi> or <hi>Characters</hi> of Things, which the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> fetches out of the <hi>Imagination,</hi> in our Souls. But there is no such <hi>Composition</hi> in our God, as to Admit of any such Successive or Dependent <hi>Motions</hi> in Him. He is a <hi>pure Act,</hi> and when we call Him so <hi>pure</hi> a Thing as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is too <hi>Gross</hi> a Name to be taken without a Figure; 'tis but by way of <hi>Analogy</hi> and <hi>Similitude.</hi> By the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God, then are meant, only those <hi>Acts</hi> of Him, which pass upon his Creatures. When we enquire, <hi>What Aspect the Almighty bears unto us,</hi> or rather, <hi>What Aspect He makes us bear unto Him,</hi> we ask after His <hi>Thoughts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us. Well then; The <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God about the men that are serviceable to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49324:8"/> His people, are, <hi>For their Good;</hi> it imports, that God will favour such men as those, with such <hi>Acts</hi> of His, as may demonstrate his Good-will unto them. The Serviceable Man may say, <hi>My God will think up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If we would know the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God, we must look into the <hi>Words</hi> of God; there is a Rule Revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by our God, according to which He will <hi>Judge</hi> of us, and He will <hi>Deal</hi> with us all; and if we would know the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God, it is but seeing what that Rule does pronounce upon us. To that <hi>Rule</hi> therefore we will now repair; and we shall find that this <hi>Rule</hi> will cnable Serviceable Men, to say as in Psal. 40. 5. <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are thy Thoughts to us-ward: If</hi> I <hi>would speak of them, they are more than can be Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Good Judgment</hi> which God passes on them, is part of his <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> for the men that are <hi>Serviceable</hi> to his people. Our God is considered as a <hi>Judge,</hi> when <hi>Thoughts</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49324:9"/> are Attributed unto Him here. What is the <hi>Good Thought,</hi> which God has for a man that studies to be Serviceable? It is, <hi>This man is a good man.</hi> When <hi>Barnabas</hi> was endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be <hi>Serviceable</hi> with a very mighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, there was that <hi>Thought</hi> presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Book of God upon him, in Acts 11. 24. <hi>He was a good man, and full of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> Every man undergoes a Trial, by that God, whose <hi>Flaming Eyes do search and knit Eyelids Try the Children of Man;</hi> and in this Trial, those men that study to Do much for the people of God, have a sentence passed on them, like that on <hi>Job, Behold, a perfect and an upright man!</hi> or like that on <hi>David, Behold, a man after Gods own Heart!</hi> or like that on <hi>Nathanael, Behold, an Israelite indeed!</hi> An Inclination to be <hi>Serviceable</hi> proceeds from such a <hi>Love</hi> to God, and such a <hi>Love</hi> to Christ, and such a <hi>Sympathy</hi> with His People, as will procure to a man, that place in the Divine Account, (1 John 3. 14.) <hi>This man is passed from Death to Life; in as much as he Loves the Brethren.</hi> When a man shall always be <hi>Doing of Good,</hi> the God of Heaven gives this as a censure of him, <hi>Behold a man that has the Spirit of the Lord Jesus in him!</hi> The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable man discovers a <hi>good principle</hi> Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him; a principle of great Respect

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hence our God <hi>Thinks well of</hi> such a man; His <hi>Thoughts</hi> are, <hi>Here are one of those good men that are upright in Heart.</hi> It is not only a <hi>just</hi> man, but also a <hi>good</hi> man, that shall always be seeking to make many others the better for him.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon the Serviceable man! The <hi>Thought</hi> of God is Transcribed into <hi>Prov. 28 20.

Let us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly put into our own Language, a few of those <hi>good Thoughts,</hi> which God will have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the men that are truly Serviceable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> One <hi>Good Thought</hi> in the <hi>Purposes</hi> of God concerning them that are serviceable to His People, is, <hi>I will be the God of that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable man.</hi> Behold, the most comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive <hi>Good</hi> that can be <hi>Thought</hi> of! When our <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could say, <hi>I have done for this People,</hi> he could also say, <hi>Think upon me for good, O MY God.</hi> Why <hi>That</hi> is the <hi>Good</hi> which God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49324:10"/> will <hi>Think</hi> to make such a man partaker of <hi>This man shall have that Liberty and Assurance which may enable him to call me HIS God.</hi> There is that Engagement made by God in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Jer. 31 33. I will be their God. This</hi> is that which Divines have truly called, the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Substance,</hi> and the very <hi>Marrow</hi> of all the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and men that are very serviceable unto the People of God, are most eminently concerned in it. Such men above any in the world may say, <hi>Deus, quantus quantus est; Totus Noster est;</hi> As good and as great as the Infinite God is, He is <hi>All ours.</hi> The Serviceable man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ventures the <hi>Loss</hi> of all other things he spends his Time, Saps his Estate, expose his Esteem, and runs the risque of his very <hi>Life,</hi> that the People of God may fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him; and Looks for no worldly <hi>gain,</hi> by what he dos.

Here may I make a stop and say, <hi>Behold this is all my Salvation, and all my Desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another <hi>Good Thought</hi> in the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi> of God, concerning them that are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to His People is, I <hi>will make that Serviceable Man to be an Honourable Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are no small <hi>Honours</hi> in <hi>This World,</hi> which God <hi>Thinks</hi> to confer upon the man that shall study to be Serviceable. I will mention some of the <hi>Honours</hi> and the <hi>Roses</hi> that shall be cast upon such a man; whereof the <hi>First</hi> shall be This, That Wicked Men will Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, Abuse, Malign such a man at a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Rate; those Vassals of the Devil, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be in a Hellish Rage at any man that shall be <hi>Serviceable</hi> unto the Flocks of the Lord Jesus, of whom they would fain make a prey. 'Tis the property of those <hi>Tories,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49324:11"/> that as in Neh. 2. 10. <hi>It grieves them exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, if there come a man to seek the Welfare of the Children of Israel.</hi> Hence an <hi>Elijah</hi> shall be rail'd at as, <hi>A Troubler of Israel; a Paul</hi> shall be storm'd at, as, <hi>A mover of Sedition.</hi> They will invent all the ways imaginable to fix Reproach upon such a man; they will make <hi>Stories,</hi> and Forge <hi>Letters,</hi> and contrive a thousand shams; in hopes that some <hi>Dirt</hi> wil stick, whereof they have <hi>Cart loads</hi> to spare. Such a man shall be, <hi>The Song of the Drunkard,</hi> and those people whose <hi>Tongues are no Slander,</hi> will try whether a <hi>Slander</hi> can't be fastned on him by the venemous <hi>Tongues,</hi> which they use as, <hi>their own.</hi> An <hi>Athanasius</hi> must be called a <hi>Sathanasius;</hi> A <hi>Calvin</hi> shall be made a Name for a <hi>Dog;</hi> An <hi>Huss</hi> must be dressed with pourtraictures of <hi>Devils</hi> round about him; a <hi>Luther</hi> long since, and since <hi>him,</hi> a <hi>Voetius,</hi> may live to see horrible tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Romances printed of the Confusions befalling of them. If a <hi>Jeremiah</hi> be drawn forth into Service, notwithstanding that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of his, <hi>I am a Child;</hi> he shall soon have cause for that complaint, in Jer. 20. 50 I <hi>heard the defaming of many, Report, say, they and we will Report it;</hi> if you will but form some <hi>Ill-Report,</hi> say they, Let us alone to blow it all about the Town▪ Pardon me,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49324:11"/> that I enumerate This among the <hi>Honours</hi> of a Serviceable Man. I should seriously exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, whether I had not been guilty of some great fault, if I should receive any Terms but those of <hi>Reproach</hi> from those <hi>Asps</hi> that rarely meet together but only to exchange <hi>Poisons</hi> with one another▪ And the Apostles were of this Opinion long before me, in <hi>Acts 5. 41 They rejoyced, that they were counted worthy to suffer shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>Honour</hi> that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable man is the Subject of; and that is, the <hi>Service</hi> it self, which God helps him to do: When God singles out a man for this and that <hi>Service</hi> to His People, 'tis an <hi>Honour</hi> from Heaven bestow'd upon him; the very <hi>Angels</hi> of the third Heaven do account it so. Tis a <hi>Disgrace</hi> infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted by God upon a man when He so layes him aside, as to accept of no <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> at his hands; very dishonourable was the Fate of an unhappy Prince, whose Name you know, in <hi>Jer. 22. 28 Is He a Vessel, wherein is no pleasure? wherefore they are cast out, he and his Seed.</hi> So tis a special and signal <hi>Honour,</hi> for a man to be remarkably serviceable in his Generation. They are the <hi>Atchievements</hi> or the <hi>Services</hi> of men, which afford unto them their only <hi>Honours.</hi> When the <hi>Honours</hi> of a worthy Person were to be recounted, we read
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49324:12"/> in <hi>Acts 9. 39. They shew'd what she had made.</hi> It is not, <hi>what we have got,</hi> but it is <hi>what we have done,</hi> that renders us truly <hi>Honourable.</hi> Now this is the priviledg of the <hi>Serviceable Man;</hi> when once the Heart of a man comes to be set upon the <hi>doing of good,</hi> commonly the good God will say upon it, <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>There is yet a further <hi>Honour</hi> befalling the Serviceable man; and that is, a precious <hi>Name▪</hi> and <hi>Room</hi> in the Hearts of godly men. Those that are themselves <hi>the Excellent in the Earth</hi> will count this man m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re singularly excellent, and will say of him, <hi>Than art worth ten thousand of us.</hi> It was the comfort of a very Serviceable man, in <hi>Esth. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That I choose to Rank the <hi>Good Thoughts</hi> of our God, mostly under the Head of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> is but an <hi>Accommodation</hi> of my Discourse unto the work of the Day before us. But▪</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To speak summarily; There are all kinds of <hi>Gracious Thoughts,</hi> in the <hi>purposes</hi> of God for the Serviceable man; and it is easier to touch a little upon the <hi>general Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of those <hi>Thoughts</hi> than to enumerate more <hi>specal Instances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short then; The serviceable man may be brought into sore <hi>straits;</hi> and indeed, whoever plunges himself into the Interests of mankind, must find himself enough perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entangled with them. But yet he may refresh his own Soul with such a <hi>Thought</hi> as that, in Psal. 40. 17 <hi>I am poor and needy;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49324:15"/> yet the Lord Thinketh upon me▪</hi> God has <hi>Thoughts</hi> for him; &amp; what kind of <hi>Thoughts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly,</p>
            <p>They are <hi>Fatherly Thoughts</hi> which God has for the serviceable man; the Lord says of him, as in Jer. 31. 20. <hi>He is my dear Son, he is my pleasant Child, I do earnestly Think upon him.</hi> The Beneficence of a serviceable man, renders him indeed the Genuine Child of such a <hi>Father.</hi> Hence they are also very <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>Bountiful</hi> and Compassionate <hi>Thoughts</hi> which God has for him. 'Tis a full Text, in Jer. 39. 11. <hi>I know the Thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord; Thoughts of Peace and not of Evil.</hi> The Lord seems to please Himself with His <hi>Thoughts</hi> for such a man; and calls him aside, as a Father will a Child, saying, <hi>Litile do you know what I think to do for you.</hi> If one would in one word <hi>speak</hi> all that we can wish for, it were <hi>Peace;</hi> but <hi>That</hi> is it which God <hi>Thinks</hi> to bestow upon us.</p>
            <p>More than this, They are <hi>Omnipotent Thoughts.</hi> It is said in Prov. 19. 21. <hi>There are many Thoughts in a mans Heart; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.</hi> Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> one for another are little fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble insignificant things; but the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of our God are Effectual, and He sais, <hi>I will do all my pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49324:15"/>
            <p>Once more; they are <hi>Everlasting Thoughts.</hi> The Lord says, in <hi>Jer. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To say no more, God will so <hi>Think</hi> of the Serviceable man, as to <hi>Hear</hi> him, <hi>Save</hi> him, <hi>Own</hi> him, <hi>Do</hi> all for him, that his <hi>matters may require.</hi> He is one that has many <hi>Thoughts</hi> of God; and we are told, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16.

                     </p>
                     <p>But if you press me to a more particular Answer still; I will in one word express the most considerable Thing that is to be done for us; Tis, <hi>Reformation! Reformation! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation!</hi> We have many and many a time confessed, <hi>That our Apostasies from God have procured unto us all the Calamities, which we are now Groaning under.</hi> And we have lately had a very large Admonition from our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Rulers, to <hi>Reform</hi> our many <hi>provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Evils.</hi> O that all ranks and kinds of people among us, were in earnest about the universal <hi>Reformation</hi> of our Manners. When the French recovered <hi>Calice</hi> from the Hands of the English, a French Captain insultingly asked an English Officer, <hi>When shall we see you at</hi> Calice <hi>again?</hi> but he made that wise Repartie upon him, <hi>Sir, when your Sins come
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49324:27"/> to be greater than ours.</hi> Truly so, it must be ascribed unto the <hi>Greatness of our sins,</hi> that we are brought into any of our inconvenient Circumstances: and 'tis the voice of our God unto us, Lev. 26. 23, 24. <hi>If ye will not be Reformed,</hi> I <hi>will punish you yet seven times for your Sins.</hi> We are beset with Devourers on every side of us, and the subduing of them all, would be to <hi>Do</hi> for us a great thing indeed. Behold an effectual way to <hi>Do</hi> it, in Prov: 16. 7. <hi>When a mans Ways please the Lord, He makes even his Enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> A Prince in <hi>Germany</hi> hearing that a Neighbour Prince intended a <hi>War</hi> upon him, immediately set himself upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> of the people under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this Adversary of his within a while after Enquired, What <hi>Preparation</hi> his Neighbour was making to oppose him, and being informed, <hi>That his chief <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was <hi>Refornration,</hi>
                        </hi> He Reply'd, <hi>Nay, then, let the Devil Fight him for all me, if he be at that, he'l be too hard for me to meddle with him.</hi> O That in like manner we were all very Busy, at <hi>Finding,</hi> and <hi>Mending,</hi> whatever the Holy God may be offended at us for; tis the sigh that the Compassionate God, is making over us, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and</hi> New England <hi>had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49324:27"/> in my ways! I should then soon have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued their Enemies, and have turned my Hand against their Adversaries!</hi> Believe it, we don't begin at the <hi>right End,</hi> if here be not the Beginning of our Services for our Countrey.</p>
                     <p>If I might go on, to a second particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Things to be <hi>Done</hi> for us, I would propound, <hi>Ʋnion,</hi> and applaud <hi>Union,</hi> and I would invite you with a Blessed <hi>Harmony,</hi> to sing that Song, <hi>Behold how good and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! There the Lord commands the Blessing!</hi> The unreasonable <hi>Quarrels, Contentions, Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> that have been among us, must be apace extinguished, or <hi>silly Chickens</hi> that we are, we make our selves a <hi>prey</hi> to the Roman <hi>Eagles,</hi> and the Indian <hi>Vultures.</hi> Travel to the <hi>East</hi> or to the <hi>West,</hi> and see whether our Invaders have made any Impressions, but where the Divisions of the people had made them <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable.</hi> I remember old <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that he came once into a City, where the people had a custome one day in a year to meet, and <hi>throw stones</hi> one at another, till many of them were killed; and yet because it was a <hi>Custome</hi> they would not leave it off. <hi>I</hi> beseech you let no <hi>such</hi> Thing be among the <hi>Customes</hi> of <hi>New-England!</hi> and let not the <hi>perverse Spirit</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> be found among us.

The Romans had a Temple Dedicated <hi>Jovi Depositorio;</hi> the Senators went thither, and laid down their mutual Dissensions before they went into the Senate-house.

                     <p>There should have been at least one thing more entred into the Catalogue of our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienda,</hi> and that is, The <hi>Regulation</hi> of our <hi>Plantations,</hi> as to several <hi>Disorders</hi> prevailing in them.</p>
                     <p>Of those <hi>Disorders,</hi> there is none more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, than that so many of them, have Lived without the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God among them. 'Tis probable, that a large part of the <hi>Americans</hi> are the Posterity of those <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites.</hi> who after the Wars of <hi>Canaan,</hi> did

God from Heaven has lately wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed against this wickedness, by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those <hi>Plantations,</hi> that had not His <hi>Defence,</hi> because they had not his <hi>Glory</hi> with them; and we are immeasurably sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and absurd, if the Warnings affect us not.
